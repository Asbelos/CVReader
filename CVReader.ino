// myFilter is an example of an OPTIONAL command filter used to intercept < > commands from
// the usb or wifi streamm.  It demonstrates how a command may be intercepted
//  or even a new command created without having to break open the API library code.
// The filter is permitted to use or modify the parameter list before passing it on to 
// the standard parser. By setting the opcode to 0, the standard parser will 
// just ignore the command on the assumption that you have already handled it.
//
// The filter must be enabled by calling the DCC EXParser::setFilter method, see use in setup().
